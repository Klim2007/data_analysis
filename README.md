# data_analysis
my personal idea of a small data analysis project 
if you are reading this: small project is not for complicated issues resolving. It was created just to show my basic python knowlages (

while doing this project i`d understand the following: 
-  create MySQL request via python, 
-  connect simple API (a made in separate module, in order to use it in upcoming projects)
-  modify data obtaing from data base using pandas
-  drowing visual graf via matplotlib (as a final result)

what does this code doing
project consists of 2 files
1. yearly_sales_graf - main code (requst to data base via mysql, creating dataframe using data from sql query and data recived from API, drowing graff (in any currency)
2. currency_pick_module - module with API request to get last exchange rates of currencies (so we can get the latest rurrency rates automatically)
